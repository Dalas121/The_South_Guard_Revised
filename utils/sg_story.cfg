            {STORY: _"Ethiliel led the South Guard through the southern forest. The deep woods became overcast with unnatural shadow as they traveled, shrouded with eerie silence and uncanny stillness. Grey darkness sapped all color from their murky surroundings, with every movement and sound muted in the thick fog. Their small company kept vigilant watch on the dense forest and on each other, wary of the foreboding ambience.

Finally, Ethiliel told them to halt and pitch camp â€” they had reached the Black River, beyond which no elf or man would willingly pass."}

            {STORY: _"Harried by an increasingly worried Ethiliel, Deoran and his company marched quickly northwards out of the great southern forest.

Yet even as they returned towards the land of men, the ominous gloom of the forest followed them. Up above, the bright sun was shrouded with grey fog, overcast with billowing clouds streaking through the sky in streams of darkened ash. Behind, the crepuscular shadow spread outward from the forest, an unnatural extension of the still-undefeated powers that lay within. It gained quickly upon them, the sinister darkness creeping ever-faster toward the men of the South Guard."}
