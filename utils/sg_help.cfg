        message=_"Wesnoth is a game about flexible strategy,
not deterministic calculation.
Anyone can win when things go as planned.
Wesnoth’s skill & mastery lie in creating
a strategy that <i><b>mitigates bad luck</b></i>, while
simultaneously <i><b>exploits good luck</b></i>. Both
bad and good luck are inevitable, so be 
ready to handle both!

Expert players are so skilled at this that
they can ironman every campaign on even 
the highest difficulty!

That said, if you really prefer a more
deterministic experience, try selecting
<i><b>“Reduced RNG”</b></i> when starting a new 
campaign."

Instead of sending your veterans

often best to use them alongside

Doing so can help spare your
