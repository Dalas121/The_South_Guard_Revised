I made no attempt to write any dialogue here. Mari's speaks-with-NPCs dialogue would need to be merged with Deoran's, unless we want her to be controllable too.

Also, you'll notice the map is somewhat different. I changed it with the intention to 1) better match the bigmap, 2) let us use the same map for the combat scenarios, 3) keep the scale small. Up to you if you want to use this one or the old one

Scenario could play out something like:

- Fiore talks with Hylas about elves, and harasses Asheviere about wedding plans (this is the first time we hear anything about Garard's bride).

- perhaps Oren doesn't speak initially (too much already going on), but if you talk to Asheviere too much he takes her away citing father's orders.

- Fiore puts Deoran in command of the undead-hunting/elf-expedition force, with his choice of Mari/Gerrick/Hylas as companion. The other, more experienced commanders are needed for the more important job of wedding prep.

- Deoran decides to walk around and speak to Mari/Gerrick/Hylas (and Asheviere), to learn more about them and decide who he wants to accompany him.

- when speaking to Mari/Gerrick/Hylas, there's a dialogue option to have them explain their stats (tanky/squishy/etc) and unique abilities (protection/leadership/heals+magic)

- Mari specifies that if chosen, she'll actually help fight, unlike in the tutorial mission. She considers undead to be serious business.

- each companion has a “I've decided. [name] and I will go meet the elves. (Finish Scenario)” dialogue option.
